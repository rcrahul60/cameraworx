                    <Typography className={classes.infoText}>Often people only care for wedding photography, but what they also should acknowledge is Wedding Cinematography. People might mistake it for wedding videography. But they both are two very different things. The videos that we see of our parent's weddings are an example of Wedding Videography. It is a more casual and boring approach to covering a wedding. This has been out of trend for some time now and what has taken its place is Wedding Cinematography. A usual Wedding Video is in 16:9 aspect ratio and is very plain looking, but when we talk about Wedding Cinematography, these videos make your wedding look like a scene out of a Bollywood Film. This video is shot with the aspect ratio of 18:9 or 21:9 aspect ratios which gives it its major cinematic feel. There is also a lot of editing involved and some of the cameras that are used to shoot these are Red Dragon and Black Magic. So if we have got you on board to get a cinematic video for your wedding then we can provide you with a fine Wedding Cinematographer in Delhi.</Typography>
